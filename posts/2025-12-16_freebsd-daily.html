        <h1>Using FreeBSD as a Daily Driver</h1>

        <p>
            Over time, FreeBSD has made enormous progress in pretty much every area.
            Since I’m an advocate for using it, for various reasons this post is the
            first in a series meant to share some changes that people may not be aware of.
        </p>

        <p>
            With the release of FreeBSD 15.0-STABLE, there is a new Tech Preview that
            changes how freebsd-update works by integrating it with pkg. This means
            you can now update your system through packages. Some parts are still a
            work in progress, and the community is actively improving them. Here
            you’ll find a few practical notes about the current state.
        </p>

        <h2>Webcam</h2>

        <p>
            Support for webcams and wireless cards has improved, and a few notes
            are worth mentioning.
        </p>

        <p>
            To use your webcam, make sure it’s one of the supported models. If it
            isn’t, please report a bug to me or file one on Bugzilla. I’m willing
            to put effort into improving support.
        </p>

        <p>
            You’ll need webcamd and cuse4bsd enabled. You can do this with the
            following commands: 
            <code>
# sysrc kld_list+=cuse4bsd
# sysrc webcamd_enable=
            </code>
        </p>
